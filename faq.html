                    (Space/Scan)</h2>
                  <p style="display: none;">A Matterport scan creates a virtual model of a house which can be “visited”
                    by the viewer in a similar way that a video game allows the player to move through a virtual space.
                    The viewer can navigate through the house at the direction using a mouse or a keyboard. </p>
                 
                  <h2 id="-how-much-does-a-matterport-3d-scan-cost-" style="cursor: pointer;">+ How Much Does A
                    Matterport 3d Scan Cost?</h2>
                  <p style="display: none;">There are many factors that go into matterport pricing, square footage, type
                    of the property, hosting and more please contact us directly for customized to your needs quote.</p>
                  <h2 id="-how-is-a-matterport-3d-virtual-tour-different-from-a-traditional-virtual-tour-"
                    style="cursor: pointer;">+ How is a Matterport 3D virtual tour different from a traditional virtual
                    tour?</h2>
                  <p style="display: none;">A traditional virtual tour isn’t a tour, but rather a video or gallery of
                    panoramic photos. Although techniques vary, most traditional tours don’t allow the viewer to move
                    around within the space. At the very most, traditional tours offer around 4- 10 individual locations
                    to view the space. Photographers use DSLR cameras to capture multiple photos that are then stitched
                    together to form a panoramic image which is then viewed using special online plugins. When we use
                    the Matterport 3D camera, it allows the viewer to explore the space in up to 200 locations that are
                    seamlessly stitched together. They can look up, look down, turn around, walk around items (such as a
                    kitchen island) and see the space from multiple angles of their choosing. Because we use a
                    professional 3D camera, we can create a completely virtual walkthrough to allow the viewer to
                    conceptualize the space better.</p>
                  <h2 id="-how-to-view-models-" style="cursor: pointer;">+ How To View Models?</h2>
                  <p style="display: none;">You will need a PC running Windows or Apple computer running OSX. Or mobile
                    device. Most web browsers are supported. We recommend Firefox for Android mobile. Most common
                    viewing problems are resolved by updating to the newest version of your web browser.</p>
                  <h2 id="-can-i-tour-the-model-with-vr-headset-" style="cursor: pointer;">+ Can I tour the model with
                    VR headset?</h2>
                  <p style="display: none;">Yes! You Will Need 4 Things For Virtual Reality With Matterport:</p>
                  <ul style="display: none;">
                    <li>Vr Ready - Your 3d tour must be vonverted to CoreVR format</li>
                    <li>Headset - Virtual reality headset (Samsung Gear Vr, Google Cardboard)</li>
                    <li>Smart phone (Any newer generation Android Phone or Apple Iphone iOS 9,1 and higher)</li>
                    <li>Matterport App - Matterport VR app</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2 id="-how-long-does-a-matterport-d-shoot-scan-take-" style="cursor: pointer;">+ How long does a
                    Matterport #D shoot/scan take?</h2>
                  <p style="display: none;">We do more scans that other Matterport providers do and typically 1,000 sq
                    ft. The area takes between 45 to 1.5hrs depends on the layout, furniture, number of floors, etc. We
                    prefer to estimate jobs at 1.5hrs per 1,000sf.</p>
                  <h2 id="-how-large-of-an-area-can-be-scanned-" style="cursor: pointer;">+ How Large Of An Area Can Be
                    Scanned?</h2>
                  <p style="display: none;">A model of an area up to 15,000 Square Feet. Can vary, depending on the
                    layout of the property and furniture.</p>
                  <h2 id="-do-you-shoot-closets-bathrooms-and-laundry-rooms-" style="cursor: pointer;">+ Do you shoot
                    closets, bathrooms and laundry rooms?</h2>
                  <p style="display: none;">Bathrooms and laundry rooms typically yes unless too small. We do not shoot
                    inside closets unless it is a large walk-in closet, approx 100sf or more, or if specifically
                    requested.</p>
              
                  <h2 id="-i-have-a-commercial-business-can-you-scan-that-" style="cursor: pointer;">+ I have a
                    commercial business, can you scan that?</h2>
                  <p style="display: none;">A Matterport scan is a great way to show off your business! If you have a
                    restaurant, retail store, school gym or even a nice office, a Matterport scan can increase interest.
                    There may be additional hosting charges for models that require web hosting for more than a year.
                  </p>
                  <h2 id="-can-you-provide-me-with-pictures-as-well-" style="cursor: pointer;">+ Can you provide me with
                    pictures as well?</h2>
                  <p style="display: none;">Yes! We can provide you with captures from the scans for your use. The
                    regular pictures are not as high quality as those you might get from a professional photographer,
                    but they are suitable for most houses.</p>
                  <h2 id="-how-long-does-it-take-after-the-appointment-for-me-to-get-my-model-"
                    style="cursor: pointer;">+ How long does it take after the appointment for me to get my model?</h2>
                  <p style="display: none;">In most cases, you will receive the completed model, landing page and links
                    in 24 – 48 hours.</p>
                  <h2 id="-how-do-i-put-the-model-on-my-website-and-share-it-with-the-world-" style="cursor: pointer;">+
                    How do I put the model on my website and share it with the world?</h2>
                  <p style="display: none;">You will receive several links upon completion of your scan. The first link
                    is branded with the agent's logo, profile picture, and a contact form. This is a great way to
                    generate leads. This link can be used on facebook, twitter, or in an email. The more you promote
                    your model, the more people will view it. You will also receive an unbranded link - this is for use
                    on the MLS. They require that virtual tours do not have any personalization or branding. Finally,
                    you will also get an “embed” code so that you can embed the model on your website.</p>
